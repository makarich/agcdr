<p><a href="http://agcdr.googlecode.com">Asterisk CDR Statistics (AGCDR)</a> is
a PHP application designed to work with data generated by the Asterisk MySQL CDR*
add-on. It produces periodical reports on the usage of your Asterisk PBX and uses

which you are responsible from one installation of AGCDR.</p>

<p><i>* A call detail record (also known as call data record or CDR) is the computer
record produced by a telephone exchange containing details of a phone call that
passed through it. It is the automated equivalent of the paper toll tickets that
were written and timed by operators for long-distance calls in a manual telephone
exchange.</i></p>
